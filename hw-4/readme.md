# hw-4 response

## Work Summary

I read through week 4's module and played around with the 2d shapes in order to understand them better. I made a self portrait, I wanted to do something different from everyone else, thus my portrait is looks pixelated.

## Steps Taken

I watched week 4's videos and read its contents, looked at the p5.js reference page, and looked my classmate's
work to get an idea of what I should do.

## Issues & Solutions

There was some trial and error figuring out how to use the 2d shapes. Radians, PI, and degrees for arcs and understanding the points for quads is still confusing. Since I couldn't master these at the moment, I decided to think simpler, but still apply effort and time.

## What I Learned

I learned of new functions and shapes and got familiar with how to use them. I now have to remember how to construct a readme markdown, as well as maneuver through github to post this correctly.

## Classmate Issues

I'm honestly bad at checking the issues and helping with resolving them, but I have seen my classmates post helpful tips here and there to help with efficiency.
