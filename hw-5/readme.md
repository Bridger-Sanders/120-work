# hw-5 response

## Work Summary

I read through week 5's module, got familiar with most of its criteria and looked at my classmates work to get an idea of what I should animate. Worked on my animation, toying with some ideas, and then I decided I would make a clock-like buddy.

## Steps Taken

- Trial and Error
- Constantly switching between *sketch.js* and the correlated *index.html* after typing a line of code.
- Refer back to examples for guidance

## Issues & Solutions

Took me awhile to figure out how to get the hands on the arms to go where I wanted them, then I remembered I could use `push()` and `pop()` with `translate()`. However, all the "simple math" related stuff is beyond me at the moment.

## What I Learned

I learned the correct way to construct readable code and how to animate in *sketch.js*. 

## Classmate Issues

I honestly didn't even look at the issues page this week, I'm terrible.
