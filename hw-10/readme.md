## Work Summary

Spent some time trying to figure out how I was suppose to organize the code from my previous project. I started with `array()`'s, naming them and giving them values. Next, I made two `function()`'s, one for the line grid and the other for the square background. I set it up so the functions would change the size, amount, space, and color of the lines or squares. Once I got that figured out I placed the arrays inside the functions.

## Steps Taken

- Trial and Error
- Constantly switching between *sketch.js* and the correlated *index.html* after typing a line of code.
- Refer back to examples for guidance
- Reading the *Getting Started with p5.js* book 
- Checking the p5.js reference page
- Watching the videos on the module

## Issues & Solutions

Had a problem where `random()` wasn't defined, so I removed it from the array I initially had it in and put it back inside the `fill()`.

## What I Learned 

I learned how to create functions and use arrays to store values.

## Classmate Issues

I have not helped my classmates.
