## Work Summary

So I used the example that was up on week 11's module page to add, remove, and change a few things. It's pretty similar to how the example works and how it looks visually, but I made my guys bright colored flying squares equipped with wings and goggles.

## Steps Taken

- Trial and Error
- Constantly switching between *sketch.js* and the correlated *index.html* after typing a line of code.
- Refer back to examples for guidance
- Reading the *Getting Started with p5.js* book
- Checking the p5.js reference page
- Watching the videos on the module

## Issues & Solutions

I had trouble getting the wings to flap simultaneously, so I isolated the left and right wing by only using strictly left and right wing code. Also had trouble with the position of the body, so matched it the left goggle location.

## What I Learned 

I learned how constructors, OOP, and `this.` work.

## Classmate Issues

I have not helped my classmates, RIP participation points.
