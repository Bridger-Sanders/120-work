# hw-3 response

## Work Summary

I downloaded the empty-example folder, extracted it's contents, and followed along with week 3's creative coding module. I made multiple copies of the empty-example folder, five of which are for practice and reference, and the other for homework.

## Steps Taken

I watched the videos and read the contents of each page set in module 3, this lead me to completing this assignment correctly. Although, I may have done some things wrong, I really don't know.

## Issues & Solutions

I forgot to unzip the empty-example folder and couldn't edit the contents in my editer. It took me an hour to figure out what the hell was going on. At first I thought Visual Studio Code could just overwrite the sketch.js, but my edits wouldn't save. So I decided to download Atom and try that editer, still didn't work. Then I watched the video on module 3's [Starting with p5](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-3/starting-with-p5/) and realized I didn't unzip the file. The whole thing was trial and error.

## What I Learned

This is tedious work and I shouldn't procrastinate, but I learned how to make shapes, canvases, texts, background colors, positions, and functions.

## Classmate Issues

I had no knowledge on how to solve most of the issues I saw, and someone would already beat me to the punch bowl for the issues I did know how to solve, making my input redundant.
