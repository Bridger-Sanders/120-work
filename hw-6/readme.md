## Work Summary

I had to work up the mustar and nerve to get my **** together, but generally I just look through the lesson plan and use it as reference. I look at the other students work to get ideas, they're my muse. 

## Steps Taken

- Trial and Error
- Constantly switching between *sketch.js* and the correlated *index.html* after typing a line of code.
- Refer back to examples for guidance

## Issues & Solutions

The planets were in grayscale for some reason when I attempted to use a variable with a color designation, so I manually put in the fill colors for the original rgb colors I wanted them to be.

## What I Learned 

Don't procrastinate or you will never see the light of day for roughly 12 hours straight per assignment.

## Classmate Issues

I have not helped my classmates, but that's due to my lack of enthusiasm.
