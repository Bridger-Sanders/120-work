## Work Summary

Came up with the idea to make a game similar to ping pong, then I started coding what I knew how to do. First was the visual parts, black background, white ball, and white paddle. Next was getting the ball to move and bounce off the edges of the canvas, along with the paddle being tracked to the mouse. Then I worked on getting the ball to bounce off the paddle, that took awhile. Finally I finished up by having the ball reset every time it went below the paddle or in this case when the ball hits the bottom of the canvas.
## Steps Taken

- Trial and Error
- Constantly switching between *sketch.js* and the correlated *index.html* after typing a line of code.
- Refer back to examples for guidance
- Reading the *Getting Started with p5.js* book
- Checking the p5.js reference page
- Watching the videos on the module
- Went to w3schools.com
- Accessed happycoding.io for reference on collision detection

## Issues & Solutions

Still having trouble how I'm suppose to lay things out with classes, constructors, `this.`, functions, etc.
Getting the ball to bounce off the paddle was difficult.

## What I Learned 

I found out that I have a lot to learn about collisions, even after getting this far.

## Classmate Issues

I have not helped my classmates.
