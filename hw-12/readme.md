## Work Summary

Came up with the idea to make a game similar to ping pong, then I started coding what I knew how to do. Then I worked on getting the ball to bounce off the paddle.
## Steps Taken

- Trial and Error
- Constantly switching between *sketch.js* and the correlated *index.html* after typing a line of code.
- Refer back to examples for guidance
- Reading the *Getting Started with p5.js* book
- Checking the p5.js reference page
- Watching the videos on the module

## Issues & Solutions

Still having trouble how I'm suppose to lay things out with classes, constructors, `this.`, functions, etc.
Getting the ball to bounce off the paddle is difficult.

## What I Learned 

I learned that I have a lot to learn, even getting this far.

## Classmate Issues

I have not helped my classmates.
