### Bridger Sanders / Section 50 / Group C

# Final Project Proposal

## Plan
- I want to create a run & jump game, the avatar has platforms to run and jump on and I might add collectables along the way for points. The objective of the game would be to gather collectables for points and not fall between the platforms, otherwise the game resets. The platforms will be moving towards the avatar and the collectables will be resting above the platforms. For difficulty I might add objects that limit the avatar, such as a temporary ankle ball so the avatar jump height is reduced or a cursed object that causes the platforms to come at them faster. I might add cannon balls that knock the avatar off platforms too.

## Influence
- My love for games, nostalgia, Nyan Cat: Lost In Space, and Doodle Jump are primarily influencing me.

## Problems
- Well, I've been putting off assignments these past few weeks, but I'm confident I can catch up as long as I'm focused and feeling the pressure of failing this class. But as far as coding goes, I guess I've got a lot to learn and cram in my mind in such a short time frame.
- Brain Cells, RIP.

## Deadlines
1. Draft ideas, review lessons, look at similar games for reference.
2. Create Local Server.
3. Create the code for the foundation of game and make sure it works.
- Save a back-up of the code before proceeding to number 4, just in case I **** up.
- Optional: Create sprite animations, create background with texts about controls and rules.
- Optional: Add sprites and adjust to animations, add aesthetic background and texts.
- Optional: Add Music
- Optional: Create and add code for power-ups and their sprite animations.

## Work Completed This Week
- Focusing on number 1 under deadlines and mostly just finishing up late assignments, should help keep the coding fresh in my head. But I am thinking ahead of what I should do and how I should manage my time. No social life for this guy these next couple weeks.
