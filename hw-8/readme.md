## Work Summary

Spent some time thinking about what I wanted to do, coming up with ideas is hard for this class. I found it troublesome to imagine how I would have to construct the code for the visual appearance. So I eventually decided I would play around with it and see what I could make.

## Steps Taken

- Trial and Error
- Constantly switching between *sketch.js* and the correlated *index.html* after typing a line of code.
- Refer back to examples for guidance
- Reading the *Getting Started with p5.js* book
- Checking the p5.js reference page
- Watching the videos on the module

## Issues & Solutions

The page kept loading with a blank canvas a few times, I realized I was missing a `}` bracket at the end of one of my for loops. Another problem was the lines would appear for the string grid and the colors for the boxes wouldn't show up either. I added a `pop()` and `push()` to isolate the `noStroke()` I had set for the boxes which seemed to fix my problem.

## What I Learned 

I learned how to string shapes together without having to create multiple lines of code.

## Classmate Issues

I have not helped my classmates.
